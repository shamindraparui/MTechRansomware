# MTechRansomware
This is my M.Tech final year research work. Ransomware is a program that encrypts all the data present on a computer, as the result, user can not do anything. After doing so, it asks for a huge ransom in order to decrypt.
This research work detects the ransomware files using machine learning technology. A trained model is there in the Model.7z. All the source code is contained within the Train.7z file.


Download the Model.7z file. Unzip it. It contains a ReadMe file. Follow it.
